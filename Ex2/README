Q.1
=====
One of the general purposes to use the multi-threading is to execute 
multiple tasks at once (in parallel).
It’s better to use the user-level threads in application (program) that 
does not need a lot of communication with I/O devices, and if we want to 
run it on different operating systems, because these threads communicate 
faster, and there is no need for kernel traps, which means low overhead, 
and because the user build a complete library for managing the threads.

Q.3
=====
We have two main interrupts and signals:
  a. Every keystroke on the keyboard triggers a hardware interrupt, 
     which received by the OS, which sends a signal to the “shell” process, 
     which executes some handler for that, eventually leads to display what
     was typed on the screen. 
  b. The shell command “kill [pid of a process]” triggers a software interrupt
     by invoking the sys call kill([pid of process], SIGTERM), SIGTERM is the default 
     signal. The kernel catches this interrupt and sends the termination signal to the 
     process, which handles this signal by terminating.

Q.4
=====
Real time: is the time that has passed in the system clock.
Virtual time: is the running time of some specific process.

Utilization of the CPU depends on the virtual time, because it measures the actual time
a process takes to be executed without the sys calls and their attached overhead. However, the
CPU usage depends on the overall time a process runs on the CPU, that is the real time.
